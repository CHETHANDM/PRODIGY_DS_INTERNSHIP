Task-01:
# Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Sample Dataset:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

Key Points:
Visualizing data distributions helps identify patterns and outliers.
Bar charts are useful for categorical variables, while histograms are suited for continuous variables.
Proper labeling and scaling are essential for clarity and readability.

Task-02:
# Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Sample Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Key Points:
Data cleaning is crucial for handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data through visualization and statistical techniques.
Identifying correlations and trends can guide further analysis and model building.

Task-03:
# Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Sample Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

Key Points:
Decision trees are intuitive and easy to interpret for classification tasks.
Proper feature selection and engineering can improve the model's performance.
Evaluating the model with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score ensures its effectiveness.

Task-4:
# Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

Sample Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

Key Points:
Sentiment analysis helps in understanding public opinion and trends.
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.) is essential for accurate sentiment analysis.
Visualization techniques like word clouds and sentiment timelines can highlight key insights.

Task-05:
# Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda

Key Points:
Identifying accident hotspots can help in preventive measures and policy-making.
Analyzing the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day can reveal critical risk factors.
Data visualization tools like heatmaps and time series plots are effective in showcasing trends and patterns.
